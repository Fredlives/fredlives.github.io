      Let us rejoice at the revival of our Beloved Lord! fOR OVER 30
      STU (standard time unit), we thought death had befallen our
      Hero. But alas, we discovered He is in fact <i>not</i> deceased,

      Why, Fred means multiple things. For one, Fred is the
      Multipresent Being that provides for us health, well-being and
      good fortune for us. Secondly, Fred is one of the standard
      measurements of time in this INTERZONE. One Fred is, naturally,
      equivalent to 15 minutes. Those are just TWO out of ONE
      definitionisms for the word FRED.
