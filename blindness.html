    <p>
      Many people go their whole lives without realising the positive
      effect that the blindnes can have on themselves. Try prohibiting
      your eyes from seeing for some time. Once you stop noticing the
      darkness, you will start to see -- and be able to communicate
      with -- the light.
    </p><p>
      If you do it right, the light should appear to you after 3 - 5
      business days. The light should resemble a middle-aged man in a
      suit, equipped with the holy artifacts: a briefcase, and a
      mobile phone. Before your blind eyes stands Fred's disciple,
      Fred.
    </p><p>
      Now now, don't act according to instincts: under all
      circumstances, avoid touching Fred. You must communicate -- nay,
      speak -- with the light wirelessly.
